	What is this?
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	This is an extension header for the OlcPixelGameEngine.
	This extension is intented to help users quickly setup a protoptype for any game or program.

	To this end, the extension provides two classes for direct use.
	the UI_CONTAINER and the UI_STAGE_CONTROLL

	the first, UI_CONTAINER handles the updateing and drawing of all UI elements,
	including bottons, drop down menus, text fields, sliders and backgroundfields, as well as asignment of a unique ID and communication with these.
	For a single page application, such as a calculator or a stand-alone main menu this contain can be used and handles all objects by it self.

	The second class UI_STAGE_CONTROLL functions on the surface exactly as the UI_CONTAINER, with one exception.
	The UI_STAGE_CONTROLL contains multiple UI_CONTAINERs at the same time and handles switching between them for the user,
	this can even be done trough Commands bound to bottons at creation time.

	To help these classes there are multiple Enums created. the most important being the pgrSTAGE enum (Program stage)
	this enum contains a list of 20 diffrent stages that teh program can be in, 10 predefined and 10 generic.
	each stage name can also be used as a command on a botton, forcing the UI_STAGE_CONTROLL to switch to that stage if one such exists.



	// All stages are:
	// predefiend
	RUN_INTRO, MAIN_MENU, RUN_PROGRAM, SAVE_LOAD,
	PAUSE_PROGRAM, INVENTORY, VIEW_MAP, CREDITS,
	HIGHSCORE, PGR_OPTIONS,
	//and generic
	PGR_STG0, PGR_STG1, PGR_STG2, PGR_STG3,
	PGR_STG4, PGR_STG5, PGR_STG6, PGR_STG7,
	PGR_STG8, PGR_STG9
	
	This PGEX will be updated when time is. pull requests and errors will be read and fixed when possible.
	suggestions are welcome.
